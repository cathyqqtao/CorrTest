phylo.CorrTest runs as a function in R. 

***This function requires 3 arguments: a branch length tree, a timetree and outgroup(s). Thus, users need to estimate branch lengthsusing their favorite methods (ML, NJ, Mp, etc.) and software (MEGA, RAxML, etc.) before run phylo.CorrTest. Timetree should be estiamted using RelTime method that implemented in MEGA with the same topology as used the branch length tree and without any calibration. This program calculates relative rates using the given branch lengths and times. Outgroups will automatically removed because the assumption of equal rates of evolution between the ingroup and outgroup sequences is not testable. 


***To run phylo.CorrTest, please install the CorrTest package and follow the steps:

	setwd('example')
	brlen_tree = read.tree('dosReis_Mammals274_ML.nwk')
	timetree = read.tree('dosReis_Mammals274_RelTime_oneCali_relTimes.nwk')
	out.tip = c('Ornithorhynchus_anatinus', 'Zaglossus_bruijni', 'Tachyglossus_aculeatus')
	
	phylo.CorrTest(brlen_tree, timetree, out.tip)
	
	
***This program requires 4 external packages: ape, phangorn, stats and R.utils.
***Install them in advance before trying the steps above. To do so, type the following command inside the R session and follow the instructions to complete the installation: 

	install.packages('ape')
	install.packages('phangorn')
	install.packages('stats')
	install.packages('R.utils')
	
	
***This program only allows binary trees.
***Currently, This program can only take trees that contain the same species. Thus, please make sure the taxa names are the same in the branch length tree and timetree before you run the program.
